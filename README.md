Polynomial Regression in Python and R

Consists of the following steps -

1. Importing the libraries
2. Importing the dataset
3. Fitting Linear Regression to the dataset
4. Fitting Polynomial Regression to the dataset
5. Visualising the Linear Regression results
6. Visualising the Polynomial Regression results
7. Visualising the Polynomial Regression results (for higher resolution and smoother curve)
8. Predicting a new result with Linear Regression
9. Predicting a new result with Polynomial Regression
